#### Instructions for Google Colab

1. Pick a model. Consider the following questions:
   - What is this model developed to do?
   - Can you write a Model and Data "biography" that covers where it came from and what data was used to train it?
   - Describe the results of working with the model, do they match your expectations?
   - Can you "break" the model? In other words, use it in a way that it was intended for and what kinds of results do you get?
2. Document your thoughts on the above questions and your experience working with Colab in a blog post. Include screenshots and screen captures of your workflow. Compare and constrast working with Colab as a tool for machine learning as related to ml5.js, python, and any other tools explored this semester.
